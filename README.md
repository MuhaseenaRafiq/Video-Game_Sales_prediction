# Video-Game_Sales_prediction
# 
This project aims to analyze global video game sales data to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to commercial success in the video game industry. The analysis involves cleaning and preprocessing the "vgsales.csv" dataset, exploring sales distribution across regions, platforms, genres, and time, and conducting correlation analysis to understand the relationships between game features and sales performance. Predictive modeling techniques like linear regression and decision trees may be used to forecast sales, with model performance evaluated by metrics like MSE or R^2. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders in the video game industry to inform development, marketing, and distribution strategies.
